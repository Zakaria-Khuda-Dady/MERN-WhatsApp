# MERN-WhatsApp

This is a website where you can Sign Up or log in with Google Auth or manually. After you Signed Up, you can create, like, delete and edit posts that you have created. your account information will be stored in the local storage. the user will be authenticated and the password will be hashed and the posts data will be stored in the MongoDB database.

I used (HTML, CSS, JS, ReactJs, Redux, NodeJs, ExpressJs, MongoDB, Mongoose, SCSS, and MaterialUI) to build this project.
